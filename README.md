# Neuroscience Domain Instance Graphs (neuDIGs)
Neuroscience Domain Instance Graphs (neuDIGs) are implementations of the DIG formalism (http://dig.isi.edu) in the context of systems-level neuroscience: an advanced, complex scientific subject. We intend this work to provide a large-scale, practical, common representation for neuroscientific knowledge that are primarily concerned with properties and characteristics of **neuron populations** that may (or may not) be explicitly identified by name. 

This repository houses the neuDIGs ontology, linked data sets that conform to it, tooling, documentation and reasoning/modeling/inference systems. It is an interpretive model (see [Burns & Chalupsky (2014) "It's all Made Up" AAAI Workshop on Discovery Informatics](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW14/paper/view/8735)) and is intended to be lightweight, practical representation linked data for neuroscience.
